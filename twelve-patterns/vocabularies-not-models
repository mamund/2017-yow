## Share Vocabularies, not Data Models

_All messages SHOULD rely only on standardized identifiers (for data/action) based on shared vocabularies. For example:_

 * IANA Link Relation Values
 * Schema.org
 * Microformats
 * Dublin Core
 * Activity Streams
 * Industry-specific dictionairies, etc.
 
### Vocabulary Example
Note the only thing shared by both client and server is the _vocabulary_ information. 
Each participant is free to arrange the contents of messages into their own internal object and/or storage model.
